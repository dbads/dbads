I have complied some ideas mostly during my college time. If you are looking to build something crazy, maybe you would find something in [here](https://github.com/dbads/Idea-Ydea).
If you like some idea, let me know. 

**If you are looking for someone to build together I am in 😄**

*I had put the idea repo private for so may years, I thought I would work on these ideas in someime future, but that seems not to work. So I made it public, if not me then maybe someone else would do it 😅*
