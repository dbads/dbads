### Hi there 👋

<!--
**dbads/dbads** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer interested in Open Source, DevOps, CI/CD, developer productivity, doing things "right", and writing things down.

- 👨‍💻 Software Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: ReactJS, AWS
- 💬 Ask me about: NodeJS, Django, APIs
- 📫 How to reach me: deepakbharti.me or on twitter @_dbads

I have complied some ideas mostly during my college time. If you are looking to build something crazy, maybe you would find something in [here](https://github.com/dbads/Idea-Ydea).
If you like some idea, let me know. 

**If you are looking for someone to build together I am in 😄**

*I had put the idea repo private for so may years, I thought I would work on these ideas in someime future, but that seems not to work. So I made it public, if not me then maybe someone else would do it 😅*
